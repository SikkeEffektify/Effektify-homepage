    or similar? What they are talking about is that Google has changed something about how they work with their ranking factors.

    Google is constantly updating its algorithms to better display the right websites to users of its search engine.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left text-white  pb-5">
    Not all ranking factors used by Google carry the same weight, some metrics are more important than others, so it’s important to focus on the most important ranking factors first.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left text-white  pb-5">
    The content of your website is one of the most important things that Google looks at.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left text-white  pb-5">
    If you have little content on your website, it will be difficult for you to appear in the search results.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-left text-white  pb-10">
    If your website contains text that is not of a very high quality or does not explain things in a simple and clear way, you will have difficulty appearing in the search results.

    <h1 class="text-right text-white  text-4xl pb-5 ">
    Copy, web copy,
    <br />
    content and substance
    </h1>

    <p class="text-sm text-white  text-right pb-10">
    There are many concepts regarding content and copy and it can sometimes be difficult to understand how they are related. That’s why we’ll briefly go through the different concepts so you know what’s what.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-left text-white  text-4xl pb-5 ">
    Is copy and web copy the same thing?
    </h1>

    <p class="text-sm text-white  text-left pb-5">
    Copy and web copy are, according to some, the same thing, you write copy whether it’s text for the web or text to be used offline.
    That approach is correct in the sense that both are about writing copy, but there is a big difference between writing classic copy and web copy.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-white  text-left pb-5">
    When writing classic copy, you can focus entirely on writing text that gets your intended audience interested in your offer.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-white  text-left pb-5">
    When writing web copy, you need to do the above, but you also need to write the text so that Google understands it and thinks it’s worth showing in search results.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-white  text-left pb-5">
    In this way, web copy is more difficult to write than classic copy because you need to know what kind of information your customers want, and you need to know what Google wants the text to contain.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-white  text-left pb-5">
    If Google decides that your text is not relevant to a particular keyword or term, they will not show your page when someone searches for that keyword.

    Content
    <br />
    and substance
    </h1>

    <p class="text-sm text-white text-left pb-5">
    So what is content and substance? Are they different things or two concepts describing the same thing? 
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    Content and content are the same thing, content is simply the English word for content.  
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    So what counts as content?  
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left ">
    There are four primary types of content on the web:  
    </p>

    <p class="text-base text-left pb-5">
        <ol class="list-disc">
            <li>Text</li>
            <li>Image</li>
            <li>Video</li>
            <li>Sound</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pt-5 pb-5">
    The most common type of content is text and is also the most easily understood by Google.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    For example, Google doesn’t see images. It’s not Google staff who visit your website, but software that reads the code on your site.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    This means, among other things, that the image file information must be correct as code is the only thing that Google “sees” when they visit your website.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    Nor do they see video or hear audio; the information describing the video or audio file must be correct for Google to understand the content.

     The text on your website is (as we mentioned earlier) one of the most important ranking factors that Google looks at.
     </p>
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     A page that contains little text, that does not explain the topic or help the reader understand the content has a very difficult time appearing well.
     </p>
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     Google’s ability to make money is directly linked to as many people as possible using their search engine.
     </p>
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     It is therefore very important for Google to display websites with relevant information when someone searches for a particular word or term. A very important part of getting Google to perceive your website as relevant is to focus on writing the right kind of text.
     </p>
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     If your page has poor text, which may also be a copy of text found on another website, it will be difficult for your website to convince Google that it is relevant to show up in the search results.
     </p>
 
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     To make it easier for you to write texts that both Google and the visitor appreciate, below is a list of things to keep in mind:
     </p>
 
     <p class="text-base text-left">
         <ol class="list-disc">
             <li>Each subpage on your website should be about one thing or topic</li>
             <li>Include the keyword in the page title</li>
             <li>Include the keyword in the main title</li>
             <li>Check search intent so that your text matches what Google expects it to contain</li>

     Every subpage on your website
     should be about a thing or a subject
     </h1>
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     When creating subpages, it is important that they focus on a specific topic. It is not uncommon to see websites where a sub-page is called “our services” and the content on that page is about many different things/services.
     </p>
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     This way of building a sub-page is not optimal as the content of the page is about many different things and therefore will not be very relevant to anything mentioned on the page.
     </p>
 
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     <em> Let’s take an example. </em>
     <br />
     Say you have a cleaning company and you have a subpage about the services you offer. If the page then contains a couple of sentences each about “business cleaning”, “private cleaning”, “window cleaning”, “moving cleaning”, “laundry”, “lawn mowing” then the page is not very relevant for Google to show up on any of these search terms.
     </p>
 
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     Especially not if a competing website has a subpage for each area that describes each area in detail.
     </p>
 
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     In other words, it’s important that every subpage on your website focuses on one thing or one topic.    
     </p>
     <hr class="my-12 h-0.5 border-t-0 bg-white opacity-100 dark:opacity-50" />

     Include the keyword  
     in the page title
     </h1>
 
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     The page title is one of the most important signals to Google. In other words, it is very important that the keyword you want that particular page to appear on has the keyword in the page title.
     </p>
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     Since the page title is what Google displays in the search results, it’s also important for your customers to see the keyword so that they understand that your website is worth visiting. Let’s continue with our previous example and pretend you run a cleaning business. If you have a sub-page that is specifically about “removal cleaning”, the word moving cleaning should be included in the page title.
     </p>
     <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
     Below is an example of how Google could display your moving cleaning subpage:
