      Working on SEO and optimising your website to rank higher in the organic results takes time. When you advertise through Google Ads, you’re instantly visible. Google Ads has been around for over 20 years, since October 2000, when Google Adwords (as it used to be called) was launched. Today, Google is undoubtedly the market leader in online advertising.

      It is often a good strategy to advertise on the keywords you want to appear on, even if you have good visibility in the organic search results, as this way you have a much better chance of getting new potential customers to your website. Of the 50 million searches made on Google every day, around 70% of visitors reach websites by clicking on links in the organic search results. The remaining 30% find their way to websites by clicking on ads via Google Ads. If you use ads and at the same time rank well organically, the chances of a customer clicking through to your website increase.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      It’s important to remember that even if you rank first organically for a keyword, Google often displays ads above the search result. In order to create a successful online marketing strategy, it is important to do a proper analysis of the market, competitors and keywords.

      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
      When you do a Google search, you see Google Ads at the very top of the page and at the very bottom of the page. The difference between Google Ads and the organic search result is that
      <em class="text-rose-300"> it is not possible to influence organic search results by paying for campaigns, </em>

      Promoting your website with Google Ads means that you pay to appear at the top of Google and you pay every time someone chooses to click on the ad.

      and the cost you pay each time a visitor clicks on your particular link is determined by the competitive situation and the keywords involved.

      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-20">
      It’s important to constantly keep track of exactly how much you’re paying for each click as it can quickly exceed the budget you’ve set for your advertising.

      Google Adwords and Google Ads is the same thing. When Google created its marketing service more than 20 years ago, they chose to call it Google Adwords.

      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
      Google decided to change the name of its service from Google Adwords to Google Ads in 2018. Before the name change for the service, terms like adwords agency and adwords consultant were often used instead of what we now call SEM agency and SEM specialist. Google made the decision to switch from Google Adwords to Google Ads in part because the market and demand has changed and does not look the same today as it did 20 years ago.

      descCustomHtml={`
      <p class="text-sm text-white text-left pb-5">
      There are many factors to keep in mind when you want to advertise on Google. An important part of any successful advertising campaign is figuring out what kind of advertising you want and what your goals are. Examples of common objectives are sales targets, increasing brand exposure and reaching out with information to customers. Ads should consist of relevant keywords based on the goals you want to achieve with Google Ads.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-white text-right pb-5">
      The ads allow you to reach different target audience needs depending on the keywords you choose. You can find out the difference between different types of keywords and their intent by searching for “buy running shoes” or “best running shoes”, for example. People who use the first search phrase are probably more likely to make a purchase decision while the second person is probably still looking for more information before making a purchase decision.
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-sm text-white text-left pb-5">
      So you need to look at the search intent behind the keyword or search phrase to understand what people are actually looking for. Looking only at a specific keyword gives only a superficial picture, while the intent behind the search determines how relevant your ad actually is to people searching for it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-white text-left pb-5">
      Another important factor is the type of matching you use when creating your different campaigns. People often talk about
      <em> Exact matching </em>
      and
      <em> Phrase matching </em>
      and it’s important to know what’s what in order to create ads with the desired results.
      </p>
  
  
      <h1 class="text-left text-white pt-10 text-3xl pb-5 ">
      Phrase matching
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-white text-left pb-5">
      By advertising with 
      <em> Phrase Match </em>
      you will see phrases and similar variants of these phrases. A phrase-matching keyword is determined by using the character 
      <em> ” </em>
      before and after the word. With phrase matching, your ads show up when someone searches for the exact keyword and any words before or after it.
      </p>
  
      <h1 class="text-left text-white pt-10 text-3xl pb-5 ">
      Exact matching
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-white text-left pb-5">
      To create ads with 
      <em> Exact Match </em>
      you use exact keywords determined by putting the character [ before and the character ] after. The ad only appears when someone searches for the exact keyword without any other terms. This type of matching is best for you if you know exactly what you want with your ads and what type of visitors you want to have to your website.

      <p class="text-sm text-white text-left pb-5">
      A very important part of working with Google Ads is to use negative keywords. In short, it means that you collect keywords in a list for which your ads should not be shown. This work is very important if you want to succeed with Google Ads and get the most out of your budget. By adding negative keywords, you avoid being seen and therefore paying for clicks from visitors who are not interested in what you offer. It’s a great way to filter out visits that cost you money without bringing in any revenue.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-white text-left pb-20">
      An example of how to use negative keywords is if you run a business that offers search engine optimisation services and want to get more potential customers with Google Ads. You want to be seen on “search engine optimization” but you obviously don’t want to pay for clicks for a visitor who searched for “free search engine optimization”. Then they make sure to make “free search engine optimisation” a negative keyword to avoid spending part of the budget on someone who is not inclined to buy.

      Google Search Text Ads
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      The most common way to use paid advertising on Google is through Google search ads. Based on what the user searches for on Google, Google displays relevant results, not only organic results, but also ads above or below the organic search result. The goal is for your ad to come up high when a user searches for what you offer. It is only when the user chooses to click on your ad that you pay, so you only have to 
      <em>pay per click</em>
      . To increase the chances of your ad being seen, it’s a good idea to optimise your ads. This is done by the following:
      </p>


      <h1 class="text-left text-2xl pb-5 ">
      Headline
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      One of the most important parts of an ad is the headline, because that’s what users see first. With Google Ads, you can have three headlines for each ad. Each heading can be a maximum of 30 characters, so it is important to use these characters well. It is beneficial to use the keyword in both the headline and the description of your ads. With Google advertising, two of your three headlines are guaranteed to appear; whether the third appears depends on the relevance and quality score of the ad.
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-left text-2xl pb-5 ">
      Description
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      With the description, you explain in more detail what it is you offer and what the customer can expect to find on the page that the ad leads to.
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-left text-2xl pb-5 ">
      URL paths
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      Google advertising allows you to customise the URL displayed in the ad instead of displaying the actual URL to your website.
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-left text-2xl pb-5 ">
      Google Search Text Ads
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      Ad extensions allow your ad to “take up more space” and appear better than competitors’ ads that don’t use ad extensions. An ad that shows well increases the chances that a customer will click on your ad instead of one of your competitors’ ads. In addition to this, the advertising add-ons allow you to add more links and showcase more of what you offer. This also allows the customer to access more pages on your website directly from the ad.

      Display Ads
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      Google has a large network of sites where your ads can appear, such as blogs, news sites or any of the many websites that Google works with. These ads appear to users who are interested in similar products that you offer or have visited a website that offers similar things to you. These ads are also shown to users who have previously shown interest in similar products that you offer but have not yet made a purchase decision. The advantage of display ads is that you have the opportunity to capture potential customers earlier in the buying process than you can with a Google search ad.
      </p>


      <h1 class="text-left text-2xl pb-5 ">
      Shopping Ads
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      Google shopping ads allow users to compare products. When users search for a specific product, relevant ads appear on Google search or under the shopping tab. You can upload your products to Google Merchant Center in text or XML format. This list contains the products you want to sell, as well as their attributes such as colour, brand, price, etc. After uploading your products to the list, enter your budget for the ads. After this is done, your products will appear on the Google Shopping platform, as well as in the search results on Google.
      </p>


      <h1 class="text-left text-2xl pb-5 ">
      Gmail Ads
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      Gmail ads are another opportunity for you to be discovered by your potential customers. These ads work based on a specific user’s account activity and appear as interactive ads that show up in your Gmail inbox.
      </p>
        
    
      <h1 class="text-left text-2xl pb-5 ">
      Google Search Text Ads
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      Second only to Google, YouTube is the world’s largest search engine and can therefore be interesting to use in your digital marketing. With something called Google Ads for video, you have the ability to show your ads in search results on YouTube, before, during and after the video is shown. It works in the same way as Google Ads, the video is uploaded to Google Ads and you set a budget for the ad. Then you pay when a user clicks and watches the video.
      </p>
    

      <h1 class="text-left text-2xl pb-5 ">
      App Advertising
      </h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      If you want to find potential users for your mobile app, it’s a good idea to market using an app ad. This advertising will result in more installs of your app as well as drive conversions in your app. With this type of ad campaign, you have the opportunity to advertise on ad networks such as Google search, Google Play, YouTube and as Display ads.
