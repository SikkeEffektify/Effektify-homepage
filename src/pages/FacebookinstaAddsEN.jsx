    Anything that is an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram is labelled as “Sponsored”, and appears just below the user’s name. But how do you know when to use Facebook Ads Manager, and what do sponsored posts and ads actually mean?

    Sponsored posts
    </h1>

    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    A sponsored post is published like a regular post, but unlike a regular post, there is an advertising budget created for the post to give it an extra push.

    <h1 class="text-left text-xl ">
    Ads
    </h1>

    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    Ads are not based on the flow of Facebook or Instagram, unlike regular posts or sponsored posts. Instead, specific content is created for the ad in question in Ads Manager, which means that ads are served entirely from the ad budget and do not receive any organic distribution.

    When creating the budget for your ad campaign, you can choose either the “daily budget” or the “lifetime budget”. Daily budget is suitable if you want your campaign to be continuous and if you want to have the possibility to adjust the budget from time to time. This option is useful if you run a business selling seasonal products or services and want to increase your budget during peak season, and reduce or pause when it’s not in season. Lifetime, on the other hand, is suitable for companies that want the campaign to be active for a limited period of time, for example while the company is running an in-store campaign or if they want to give an event a push.

    How big should the budget for an advertising campaign be? 
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    As for the size of the budget, a larger budget gives greater visibility, apart from the design of the advertising campaign, which is also an influencing factor. The better the ads are designed, the more reach you get for every penny you pay.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    There is no general answer for how big the budget should be, but the best thing to do is to experiment to see what’s right.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-left text-3xl pb-5 ">
    Step 1.
    <br />
    Choosing campaign goals
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    The first step to take when creating an ad campaign is to choose a campaign target. When you choose the target for your campaign, Facebook helps you both to create an appropriate ad based on the target and to adjust the budget so that it’s just right, and so that you achieve your desired result.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    The objectives are divided into three different categories, awareness, consideration and conversion.
    </p>

    <i class="fa-regular fa-square-check text-green-500 fa-2xl"></i>
    <h1 class="text-center text-3xl pb-5 ">
    Awareness
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    Awareness is an appropriate choice for companies that want to reach a wide audience online, or that want to reach a new audience online that is not already familiar with the brand. In this category, you can choose “brand awareness”, which means that your ads are shown to people who are most likely to like your brand. You can also choose “reach”, which is suitable for businesses that want to reach as many people as possible.”
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    “Brand Awareness” works well for those who want to reach more people similar to those who already interact with the company’s brand online on Facebook and Instagram. However, if it is a new account, or if the idea is to manage a new audience, “reach” is a better choice. However, it is good to create ads that arouse interest and curiosity in this choice as the ads will be widely visible, and thus they will also be visible to people who are not familiar with the brand in question.
    </p>


    <i class="fa-regular fa-square-check text-green-500 fa-2xl"></i>
    <h1 class="text-center text-3xl pb-5 ">
    Consideration
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    Consideration is a category suitable for those companies that want to increase brand awareness. In this category, there are six different objectives that are meant to be chosen based on how you want your target audience to become familiar with your brand. “Traffic” is appropriate if you want the visitor to be redirected to a website for more information.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    “Interaction” is appropriate if you want your audience to engage with the content in question, this can be done by allowing them to comment on the post, for example. “App installation” is used when your goal is for the target audience to install an app. “Video views” are used when you want to convey information through a video. “Lead generation” is appropriate if your goal is to collect email addresses, often used when you want to send out newsletters. “Messages” is appropriate if you want your audience to contact you by sending messages.
    </p>

    <i class="fa-regular fa-square-check text-green-500 fa-2xl"></i>
    <h1 class="text-center text-3xl pb-5 ">
    Conversion
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    Conversion is a category for the target group that you want to achieve the final goal, such as a purchase. In this category there are three different objectives, depending on where you want the target group to make their conversion.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    “Conversions” can be used in conjunction with the Facebook pixel to optimize your ads depending on how they perform on your website. “Catalogue sales” is often used to display products directly from your product catalogue on Facebook. “Store traffic”, if you want your target audience to make their purchase in a physical store, this target is appropriate as it allows you to show your ads to people nearby.

    Step 2:
    <br />
    Create an Ad Set
    </h1>   
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    When you create an Ad Set, you can choose who you want to reach, and when and where. When specifying the target audience, you can select factors such as gender, age and geography, but also factors such as the target audience’s interests and life situation to help Facebook identify the target audience through the data collected.
    </p>

    <h1 class="text-left text-3xl pb-5 ">
    Step 3:
    <br />
    Create ads
    </h1>   
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
    This is where you create the ad content, i.e. what the target audience will see. In this step, it is important to adapt the benefit, image/video and text to your set goal, the target audience and the channel you have chosen to use. You can also create several different ads with different texts and images/videos and then decide which one is the most effective.
    </p>


    <h1 class="text-left text-3xl pb-5 ">
    Step 4:
    <br />
    Publish your ads
    </h1>   
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    The first step to take when creating an ad campaign is to choose a campaign target. When you choose the target for your campaign, Facebook helps you both to create an appropriate ad based on the target and to adjust the budget so that it’s just right, and so that you achieve your desired result.
