      By advertising with sponsored content, LinkedIn ads show up in the flow of your targeted audience. LinkedIn marks these posts as sponsored to make it clear that they are different from regular content. Sponsored content is visible whether you use LinkedIn on mobile or desktop.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      The types of ads available as sponsored content are single image ads, video ads, gallery ads and event ads.

      This is a great way to drive conversions tailored to the target audience in question. However, the landing page needs to be optimised, as well as mobile-friendly. Be clear about the benefits to the member of engaging with your messages.

      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      These LinkedIn ads are also known as Text Ads and are placed on LinkedIn pages that are adapted for this type of advertising. The ads appear at the top right of the feed. However, only on desktop. This type of ad is a great option for those who want to build professional leads.

      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
      The first step you need to take to create LinkedIn Ads is to create a Campaign Manager account, which therefore requires your company to have a LinkedIn page. If you don’t have a LinkedIn page, it’s easy to arrange. Be careful to fill in as much as possible when creating your page, as details can help you rank higher.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
      Then you need to set an ad target. On LinkedIn, you can choose from several different ones. Whether your goal with advertising is to generate more visitors to your website or create more leads, there are appropriate goals to choose.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
      Now it’s time to choose your target audience. You can choose specializations such as industry, location, skills and education. By making these targetings, you can ensure that your ad is shown to the right people. Here you can also choose to exclude a particular type of audience if it is irrelevant to you.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
      Once you’ve created your ads, it’s time to choose an ad format. You can choose between text ads, dynamic ads or video ads. The budget and schedule for the advertising campaign are then set. Campaign Manager gives you a suggested budget based on other ad campaigns similar to yours.

      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
      It is very important to analyse the results of your LinkedIn ads to see if your investment has paid off. By analysing the data from your advertising, you can easily get information on whether it is relevant to continue running the same ads or whether it is no longer profitable for your business to spend money on these particular ads. It may turn out that some LinkedIn ads work better than others and that you therefore want to focus on these only.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
      Campaign Manager also has a feature where you can track key metrics to get an understanding of how your ads are performing. This feature includes statistics on factors such as number of clicks, impressions, cost per click, click-through rate, cost per impression, conversions, cost per conversion, potential customers and cost per lead.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-left pb-10">
      Based on your analytics, you can optimize your ads and continue to test to get the best possible output from your advertising.

      In digital marketing, backlinks are important. The same applies when you want to rank your LinkedIn profile higher. Getting as many backlinks as possible to your LinkedIn profile will make a big difference. The more links you have to your page, the more people will see your profile. If more people get involved, your profile will rank higher. This is a great way to raise your page’s authority and drive traffic to your profile.
