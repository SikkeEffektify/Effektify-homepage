      Many SEO practitioners would say that it takes about four to six months before you start seeing the effects of it.

      Doing a<em> keyword analysis </em>
      will give you a better idea of which keywords are worth focusing on. To find the best keywords for your industry, you must first 
      <strong class='text-rose-300'> understand the situation of your target audience. </strong>
      By searching for what you want to be seen for yourself, you’ll get a better idea of how others search for what you offer.

      <p class="mb-2 text-sm tracking-wider" >
      It is important to know who your target audience is and to be specific about their needs. If your content is about animals, it’s too vague to just use the word “animals” as a keyword. If your website is about “the most popular pets”, the use of this keyword phrase will be more relevant to what your target audience is looking for.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2 text-sm tracking-wider" >
      Once you have identified some possible keywords and phrases that are relevant to your target audience, it is important to do further analysis around them. 
      <strong class='text-rose-300'> If you use keywords that are too popular, it can be difficult for your website to rank well against your competitors’ websites. </strong>
      Instead, using keywords that are not popular at all may mean that few people will ever search for the keywords in question.
      </p >
      <p class="mb-2 text-sm tracking-wider" >It is therefore essential that you examine the search volume and potential competition for all the keywords you are considering. One way to do this is to use the <em>Google Trends</em> tool.</p>

    <p class="mb-2 tracking-wider text-sm text-white"><strong class="text-rose-300">Content creation </strong>
