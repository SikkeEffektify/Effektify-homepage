    Search engine optimization, or SEO as it is also known, is a type of digital marketing where the aim is to increase your visibility in the search enginesâ€™ organic results. Search engine optimization is therefore about appearing well in the results that are not paid ads on search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo. If done correctly, SEO will result in your website appearing high up in search engine results for relevant searches. This SEO work means that you get more visitors to your website, which you can then hopefully convert into customers.
