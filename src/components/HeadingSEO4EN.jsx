    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    A keyword analysis is important in order to select words that are relevant to your business and to optimize your website accordingly. A good and relevant keyword for your business will generate money. The keyword analysis is done to find out how high the search volume is for the keyword, how high the competition is for that particular keyword, and what the search intent of the keyword is so that it is definitely relevant to you and your business.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    It is important to find out what the search volume is for a keyword in order to know the business case for appearing on that particular keyword. It is also very important to assess the difficulty of appearing on the keyword in question. Since there are only ten positions on the first page of Google, you need to be able to “push down” one of the websites that already has one of these positions. This means that there is constant competition for first page rankings, and your website must therefore be better than the website whose ranking you want. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    Therefore, it is important to find out what the competition for a specific keyword looks like. In addition, it is also important to assess the search intent for a specific keyword. Google is constantly trying to understand what kind of information their users want to find when they make a specific search. Based on what Google believes is the intent of the search, it displays websites that Google believes best match the user’s search intent.

    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">
    Another good thing to know is that there are three basic types of searches, information searches, navigation searches and transaction searches. An information search is made when the user wants to know more about something, how it works or how to do something. A navigation search is made when the user knows what they are looking for and uses Google to navigate them to the right website. A transaction search is often made when the user is ready to make a purchase decision.
