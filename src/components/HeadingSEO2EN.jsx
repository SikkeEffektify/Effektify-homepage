    <h1 class="text-3xl uppercase pb-5">What is SEM?</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-left pb-5">When it comes to digital marketing and appearing high in search results, in addition to working with SEO, you can also work with SEM, or Search Engine Marketing. Unlike using search engine optimization to appear in the organic results, advertising through 
    <strong class="text-rose-300"> <a href="https://effektify.com/en/google-ads/"> Google Ads </a> </strong>
    allows you to appear high up in the search results.
    </p> 
    
    <h1 class="text-center pt-5 text-lg pb-5 uppercase">As with SEO, you need to analyze and optimize your ads correctly so that you appear higher than your competitors on the keywords you want to appear on.</h1>
      <p class='text-sm pb-5 text-left'>Together, SEO and SEM are now an essential part of increasing traffic to your website and getting more visitors and customers. Approximately 70% of all visitor traffic comes from the organic results using SEO. The remaining 30% reaches your website through clicks from ads and is therefore a good complement for those who want to increase your relevance in the eyes of search engines and thus increase your sales.</p>
      <p class='text-sm pb-5 text-left'>In addition to SEO and SEM, there are a number of other factors that are important when search engines evaluate your website to determine whether it is more relevant to display than your competitors’ pages. Some of these factors are:</p>

        On-page SEO
        </li>
        <p class='text-left pt-2 text-sm'>
        An important part of SEO is on-page, which has a huge impact on whether or not your website is seen online. On-page is the visible part of SEO work, and includes everything from fixing technical aspects of your website to the information contained on your website (text, images, videos, etc.), as well as how this information is structured. Some factors that are important to optimize for search are the loading speed of the website, page titles, page headings, page images, page URLs and copy.

        <li class=" pt-5 uppercase text-left text-rose-300 text-xl">
        Website loading speed
        </li>
        <p class='text-left pt-2 text-sm'>
        One of the factors that affects Google’s assessment of your website is how quickly the browser loads your website. Google avoids displaying websites that load slowly and therefore it is a great disadvantage for you if your website has poor loading speed. Google has created a tool that you can use to find out the loading speed of your website. The tool shows how fast the website loads, both on mobile and desktop. If the tool would show less than 50 points, you should review what you can do to improve the charging speed.

        <li class=" pt-5 uppercase text-left text-rose-300 text-xl">
        Home page headlines
        </li>
        <p class='text-left pt-2 text-sm'>
        Another important factor in basic SEO is the website’s headlines. This is also something that Google pays a lot of attention to in order to get an idea of what the page is about. Google appreciates structure, so your text should have a logical headline structure where the headings simply explain what the text is about. A website with a good headline structure is perceived by Google as high quality.

        <li class=" pt-5 uppercase text-left text-rose-300 text-xl">
        Website texts
        </li>
        <p class='text-left pt-2 text-sm'>
        Google finds it important that the text on your website is structured and of high quality. Google also looks carefully at what your text is about. Avoiding strange sentences and spelling mistakes is to your and your website’s advantage.

        <li class=" pt-5 uppercase text-left text-rose-300 text-xl">
        The website's images
        </li>
        <p class='text-left pt-2 text-sm'>
        Another important and fundamental factor in SEO is a website’s images. Google cannot “see” what images represent, instead the search engine reads code, so it is essential that image file information is optimized.
        </p>


        <li class=" pt-5 uppercase text-left text-rose-300 text-xl">
        The website's url
        </li>
        <p class='text-left pt-2 text-sm'>
        The website URL/web address is also important in SEO. A URL explains what a website is about, hence it is beneficial to make it clear and ensure that it describes the website’s content.
        </p>


        <li class=" pt-5 uppercase text-left text-rose-300 text-xl">
        Content
        </li>
        <p class='text-left pt-2 text-sm'>
        Content, or content as it is called in English, is something Google is finding increasingly important. Google strives to showcase websites that it believes give its users the best possible response. For those of you with a website, this means that the content of your website is important to whether or not you show up on Google when someone googles what you offer.
